# Known limitations
{: #known-limitations}

This section details some of the known limitations of {{site.data.keyword.dns_short}}.
{:shortdesc}

 * This service is supported for VPCs (Gen1) that are created after 10/8/2019. To use the service for VPCs created prior to that, follow [this process](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/1086243) to open a support case.
 * To add a VPC into permitted networks for a DNS zone, users must have the **Operator** role with **all VPC Infrastructure Resources**.
 * When adding a VPC to a permitted network through the UI, you cannot add a VPC from a region that contains more than 8 VPCs. Use the API or CLI to add the VPC directly to the permitted network call using its CRN.
