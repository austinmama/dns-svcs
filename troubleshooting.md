## Unable to perform name resolution with NXDOMAIN error.
* Verify the server you are sending the request from is configured to use the DNS resolvers `161.26.0.7` or `161.26.0.8` 
* Verify the server you are sending the request from is part of a VPC that has been added as a permitted network to the DNS zone.
* Verify the FQDN for which name resolution is attempted has a Resource Record in the DNS zone. 
* Verify the DNS request is using the right Resource record type in the query.

## Adding Permitted Network gave an error that VPC does not have Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE) enabled. 
* By default only VPCs created on or after 10/09/2019 are enabled to use with Private DNS. 
* For to VPCs created before that, as a permitted network, please review https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/1086243 to contact support and get the VPC CSE enabled. 
* You will then be able to add this VPC for your DNS zone.

## Unable to add permitted network
Check if you are trying to add duplicate zone and networks.

For example:
```
- Create zone1.com with network-1
  - Create zone1.com is successful
  - Add network-1 is successful

- Create duplicate zone1.com with network-1
  - Create zone1.com is successful
  - Add network-1 fails
```

Duplicate zone and networks cannot be added.
