# Adding DNS records
{:#adding-dns-records}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} DNS Services is in Experimental Release. At this time the service is available to whitelisted customers only.
{: important}

  1. From the DNS zones table click on the zone name to which you would like to add record(s). You will see more details on selected zone. 
  2. Click on `Add Record` button. You will see a side panel for creating a record.

You can use the **Type** dropdown to select the type of record you want to create. Each DNS record type has a Name and Time-To-Live (TTL) associated with it. 

Whatever is entered into the Name field will have domain name appended to it unless domain name is manually appended in the field already (for example if `www` or `www.example.com` is typed into the field, the API will handle both as `www.example.com`). If the exact domain name is typed into the name field, then it won't be appended on itself (for example, `example.com` will be handled as `example.com`). However, the list of DNS records will only show the names without the domain name being tacked on, so `www.example.com` is shown as `www` and `example.com` will be shown as `example.com`. The TTL will have a default value of `1 min`, but can be changed by the user.

## A Type record

## CNAME Type record

To add this record type, a valid value must exist in the **Name** field and a fully qualified domain name must be in the **Target** (FQDN) field. A **TTL** also can be specified from the dropdown menu, with the default value of `1 min`.

    Required Fields: Name, Target (for CNAME)
    Optional Field: TTL (Default value is 1 min)

## MX Type record

To add this record type, a valid value must exist in the **Name** field, a fully qualified domain name must be in the **Mail Server** (FQDN)field and a valid number must exist in the **Priority** field. A **TTL** also can be specified from the dropdown menu, with the default value of `1 min`.

## PTR Type record

A **TTL** also can be specified from the dropdown menu, with the default value of `1 min`.
